What you'll learn
Estimated time: 15 minutes
By the end of this lesson you'll be able to:

Compare skills to CLAUDE.md, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers
Choose the right Claude Code customization feature for a given use case
Design a complementary setup that combines multiple features effectively

(3 minutes)

Claude Code offers several customization options, and choosing the wrong one can lead to unnecessary complexity. This video breaks down when to use skills versus CLAUDE.md, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers. You'll learn the key differences between each option and how they complement each other in a typical development setup.
Key takeaways

CLAUDE.md loads into every conversation and is best for always-on project standards. Skills load on demand and are best for task-specific expertise
Subagents run in isolated execution contexts — use them for delegated work. Skills add knowledge to your current conversation
Hooks are event-driven (fire on file saves, tool calls). Skills are request-driven (activate based on what you're asking)
MCP servers provide external tools and integrations — a different category entirely from skills
Each feature handles its own specialty — combine them rather than forcing everything into one approach

Claude Code offers several customization options: Skills, CLAUDE.md, subagents, hooks, and MCP servers. They solve different problems, and knowing when to use each prevents you from building the wrong thing. Let's break them down.
CLAUDE.md vs Skills
CLAUDE.md loads into every conversation, always. If you want Claude to use TypeScript strict mode in your project, put it in your CLAUDE.md file.
Skills load on demand. When Claude matches a request to a skill, that skill's instructions join the conversation. Your PR review checklist doesn't need to be in context when you're writing new code — it activates when you ask for a review.

Use CLAUDE.md for:

Project-wide standards that always apply
Constraints like "never modify the database schema"
Framework preferences and coding style

Use Skills for:

Task-specific expertise
Knowledge that's only relevant sometimes
Detailed procedures that would clutter every conversation

Skills vs Subagents
Skills add knowledge to your current conversation. When a skill activates, its instructions join the existing context.
Subagents run in a separate context. They receive a task, work on it independently, and return results. They're isolated from the main conversation.
Use Subagents when:

You want to delegate a task to a separate execution context
You need different tool access than the main conversation
You want isolation between delegated work and your main context

Use Skills when:

You want to enhance Claude's knowledge for the current task
The expertise applies throughout a conversation

Skills vs Hooks
Hooks fire on events. A hook might run a linter every time Claude saves a file, or validate input before certain tool calls. They're event-driven.
Skills are request-driven. They activate based on what you're asking.
Use Hooks for:

Operations that should run on every file save
Validation before specific tool calls
Automated side effects of Claude's actions

Use Skills for:

Knowledge that informs how Claude handles requests
Guidelines that affect Claude's reasoning

Putting It All Together
A typical setup might include:

CLAUDE.md — always-on project standards
Skills — task-specific expertise that loads on demand
Hooks — automated operations triggered by events
Subagents — isolated execution contexts for delegated work
MCP servers — external tools and integrations

Each handles its own specialty. Don't force everything into skills when another option fits better — and you can use multiple at a time. Skills provide automatic task-specific expertise, CLAUDE.md is for always-on instructions, subagents run in isolated contexts, hooks fire on events, and MCP provides external tools.
Use skills when you have knowledge that Claude should apply automatically when the topic is relevant, and combine them with other features for comprehensive customization.
Lesson reflection

Look at your current CLAUDE.md file. Is there anything in it that would work better as a skill (loaded only when relevant)?
Think about your team's development workflow. Which combination of Claude Code features (skills, hooks, subagents, MCP) would address your most common pain points?

What's next
In the next lesson, you'll learn how to share skills with your team and organization — from committing them to repositories, to distributing via plugins, to enterprise-wide deployment through managed settings.
